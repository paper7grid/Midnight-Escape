# Midnight-Escape
Join a daring skeleton on a midnight run through a haunted graveyard! Guide the skeleton through a haunted world filled with graves, jelly blobs, and crows. Jump over obstacles and slide under dangers to stay alive. The further you go the faster it gets, oh and let's see if you can have a record high score!

You guys remembeer the no-internet-Dino-game??? well this is the spookier version of that! 
This is a scroll slider platformer game, I made in Godot! it includes three obstacles: Jellyblob, grave and a raven (crow). The skeleton can jump and duck to dodge the obstacles while trying to escape the graveyard.
Some issues I faced were majorly learning how to do it, since I am pretty new to this software, and trying to set all the things perfectly. 
I also created Jelly blob myself!! 
I really enjoyed creating this game and hope you have fun too!
